Waterfall enrichment is a systematic process used in lead enrichment that leverages multiple data providers sequentially to enhance and verify prospect information12. This method is designed to maximize the coverage and accuracy of lead data by using various sources in a predetermined order6.

## How Waterfall Enrichment Works
Initial Data Input: The process begins with basic prospect information, such as name, company name, and domain5.

### Sequential Vendor Checks:

The data is first sent to the primary vendor for enrichment and verification.

If the primary vendor can't provide complete or accurate information, the data moves to the second vendor.

This process continues through subsequent vendors until all required attributes are matched or all designated sources have been queried.

### Data Verification:
Each step includes verification of the information obtained, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

### Benefits of Waterfall Enrichment
**Improved Data Quality:** By using multiple sources, waterfall enrichment significantly enhances the accuracy and completeness of lead data.

**Cost-Effective:** It avoids paying multiple times for the same data by only progressing to the next vendor when necessary.

**Wider Coverage:** Different vendors excel in different areas (e.g., regions, company sizes), allowing for better overall data coverage.

**Time-Efficient:** Automated waterfall enrichment saves time compared to manual processes, delivering verified results quickly.

**Enhanced Lead Generation:** It provides sales and marketing teams with deeper, more complete views of potential customers, enabling better segmentation and targeting.

Waterfall enrichment has become more accessible and practical with advancements in automation and integration capabilities, making it a valuable tool for businesses focused on high-quality B2B marketing, sales, and customer engagement.
